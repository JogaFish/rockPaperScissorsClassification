# rockPaperScissorsClassification
Machine Learning project that classifies whether user is showing the rock, paper or scissors hand gesture

**To run this project:**
- Download all files onto a virtual environment
- Download all dependencies in the requirements.txt using pip

**To use this project:**
- run modelBuilder.py to create the model and export it into your virtual environment
- run predictor.py to live predict what gesture you are making

I made this project to see if I could use Keras classification models along with computer vision software (MediaPipe and OpenCV) to predict hand gestures.
The future application of this project can be a live rock paper scissors game or using this model to identify other hand gestures, such as ASL alphabet.
